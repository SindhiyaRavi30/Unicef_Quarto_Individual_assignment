# Unicef_Quarto_Individual_assignment
This Quarto report presents an in-depth analysis of global mobile phone ownership using data from two primary sources: unicef_indicator_2.csv and unicef_metadata.csv. The project explores how mobile access varies across countries, genders, economic conditions, and inflation levels — offering insights into digital inclusion worldwide.

Through maps, bar charts, time series, and scatter plots, the report shows that mobile ownership is influenced not just by GDP, but also by structural factors like affordability, infrastructure, and gender equity. The visualisations aim to support UNICEF’s mission of ensuring equitable access to digital technology, especially for underserved populations.
